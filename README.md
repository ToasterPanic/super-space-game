# Super Space Game Demo Branch

Welcome to the demo branch for Siege week 15!

## Description

18 September, 2140 [EARTH STANDARD TIME]. Ash Milian wakes up from a coma. Remembering nothing about the world or their life, you must fly around the C022 solar system as a mercenary to find answers to who you are, and why you're here.

A full remake of my previous Space Game with far more features, content and functionality. The only borrowed assets from the original game are sound effects, and also the code for stars. Turns out that's hard to do right. 

I likely will finish this game after siege, although it will not be immediately.

## Hints for testers
Above all else: THIS IS A PROTOTYPE. While I'm definitely making this into a proper game, it's still a prototype. It's not perfect. It's probably buggy. But I've put a lot of effort into it, so I get a gold star for effort (I will eats it :3)

- In your ship, you can press the SELECT/SHARE/BACK/- button on your controller (or CAPS LOCK on PC) to open the navpanel. You can fast travel and pick up contracts.
- The only real content is in the intro and first contract.
- In the intro, you probably shouldn't fight the enemies that chase you. They are very beefy.
- The first contract is not finished.

The following hints require the console, which can be opened with the TILDE key (the key with ~ on it, usually below [ESC].)

- You can use `summon_enemy` in the console while in space to summon an enemy ship behind you.
- Unable to unholster your gun? Use the console command `give_ground_gun pistol` and try again.
