# Super Space Game Demo Branch

Welcome to the demo branch for Siege week 15! If you're here for the prototype, go away!

## Description

18 September, 2140 [EARTH STANDARD TIME]. Kendall wakes up from a coma. After recieving a generous offer from a military group, you must fight to survive, and find answers on who you are.

A full remake of my previous Space Game with far more features, content and functionality. The only borrowed assets from the original game are sound effects, and also the code for stars. Turns out that's hard to do right. 

I likely will finish this game after siege, although it will not be immediately.

## Hints for testers
Above all else: THIS IS *STILL* somewhat of a prototype. While I'm definitely making this into a proper game, it's still a prototype. It's not perfect. It's probably buggy. But I've put a lot of effort into it, so I get a gold star for effort (I will eats it :3)
